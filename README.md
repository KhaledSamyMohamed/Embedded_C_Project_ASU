# Embedded_C_Project_ASU

Remote IoT Data monitoring and Controling using Wi-Fi (esp-01) with At_commands .                                                                                             
Implemented the following drivers  LCD, UART, Timer, ADC for Atmega328P

The motion sensor and temperature sensor and smoke sensor prints their data on LCD and all connected to ESP with arduino and when motion detected or temperature goes above 200 it’s appear on the website and you can turn on or off two led by pressing on two buttons on the website
